== Description ==

= E-Prime is a proven writing style that improves clarity and eliminates the passive voice =

A simple idea that works wonders: A writing hack to level up your content quickly.  [E-Prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime) is secret trick that professional copy writers hold dear.

This plugin will change the way you write content and make your landing pages more effective.  Boost your conversion rates through stronger langauge. Your content gains a commanding authoritative voice associated with journalists and experienced marketing professionals.

The WordPress E-Prime Grammar Checker plugin monitors your edits in realtime and notifies you when your content fails to conform to the E-Prime standard.  We think the unobtrusive animations are subtle enough to catch your attention but not distracting in anyway.

As a bonus feature we've built in support for all the major plugins so that you can check the E-Prime compliance with your WooCommerce product descriptions. 
You can monitor your Yoast SEO Metadata and keywords. Basically, if you take E-Prime seriously then so will we.

This plugin does not check all English grammar rules, we leave that to your browser's built in features. It only shows information about the limited set of E-Prime rules.

Give it a try, we think you'll love it!

Your SEO and Marketing Managers will thank you.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is E-Prime? =

E-Prime (short for English-Prime or English Prime) is a version of the English language that excludes all forms of the verb 'to be', including all conjugations, contractions and archaic forms.

= Why use E-Prime? =

 scholars advocate using E-Prime as a device to clarify thinking and strengthen writing. You'll notice it everywhere you find professionally writen copy.

Use of E-Prime leads to a less dogmatic style of language that reduces the possibility of misunderstanding or conflict. It avoids the misuse of the verb 'to be' as creating a deity mode of speech, allowing even the most ignorant to transform their opinions magically into god-like pronouncements on the nature of things.

= What happens if I break the rules of E-Prime? =

Nothing. Something. Everything. Breaking the rules can enhance the prose considerably.  The benefit of rule breaking comes from the uniqueness of that experience.  If your writing is littered with 'to be' it loses that God Like power it deserves.  Hold it in reserve to really punch up that particular statement in your content.

= Does this work with WooCommerce? =

Yes, E-Prime Grammar checker will improve the readability of your product descriptions, coupon code, and checkout pages. If you Woo with WooCommerce then this grammar checker will work for you.

= Does this work with Yoast? =

Yes, E-Prime Grammar checker will improve the readability of your SEO metadata title (meta-title) and metadata description (meta-description) tags just as it improves your copywriting elsewhere on your site.

= Does this work with other Popup-Builders and Page-Builders? =

Probably, but if not, please do let us know and we'll work quickly to get your favorite Popup-Builders and Page-Builders supported.  E-Prime was designed primarily for the Gutenberg editor.

= Does this check insecure content? =

No, this only works while editing your pages via the Admin Dashboard.  It will not check for insecure content

= Does this check the alt and title tags in the Media Library? =

Yes it does!  Though we could use some help making the media library modal smaller and keep it from obscuring the admin bar.  The E-Prime Violation notice area is mostly invisible while in the Media Library.

= What about email Plugins? =

Yes, this should work with any email plugin that allows you to edit the email templates fro MailChimp, SMTP, SendGrid, et al.   If you encounter any problems please contact us and we'll work to add support for your favorite Plugins
