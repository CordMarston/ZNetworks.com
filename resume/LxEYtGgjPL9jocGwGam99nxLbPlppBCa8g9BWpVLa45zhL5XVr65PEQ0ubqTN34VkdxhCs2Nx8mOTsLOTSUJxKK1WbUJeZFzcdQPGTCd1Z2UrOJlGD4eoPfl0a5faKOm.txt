During the course of 35+ years I have worked in the Long Term Care industry across multiple server platforms from Unix/Xenix, DOS, Windows to local PCs. Ranging from standalone access to multiuser through local servers to Cloud environments access. I have managed Active Directories in many Windows server environments while installing and supporting Clinical and Accounting software to LTC facilities throughout the nation. In doing so flexiblity and being HIPPA compliant is a must . I have train and assisted in remote and local access to needed applications . Ability to create and modify IIS settings for local and remote access to web based applications. I have a strong user communication skill with others to gain information needed to allow user best results to perform their needed daily tasks. I have utilized multiple Webx services to communicate externally to active servers.
I support multiple Windows apps such as SQL, O386, Skype for Business, along with Adode, Java, Cisco, Citrix, and other sources of remote communication. Ability to link data traffic from one source to another either though text or HL7. Ability to support and maintain data backups and security both in house and off site. I have been HIPPA certified.
In short understanding the desired goals of the internal process reaching "outside the box" to maintain stable communication between user and server so that the user can accomplish their daily tasks.
