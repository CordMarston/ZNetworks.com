Dear ZNETWORKS,

My name is Kadeon and I would like to work with you as a partner to sell your products and services.  One strategy is that you could sponsor me to attend networking events such as trade shows and conferences and I can have a booth where I hand out your marketing materials and converse with individuals about your services.  Then when I get home, I could follow up with an email/phone call and make that final strong sales pitch.  I find that face to face marketing tends to work better than cold emails.  Moreover, most companies these days have very strong spam filters.  Another good strategy is to join a local Chamber of Commerce.  We could send emails to their directory with an intro "Hi, I found your company in the xxx Chamber of Commerce...".  I could also attend meeting organized by the Chambers of Commerce and market your services that way.  Finally, we could run ads on Facebook and then I could follow up as people comment under the ads.  Lots of ideas!

In terms of my background, I have Bachelors' degrees in Spanish and Information Systems and I am a part time student in the Engineering for Professionals program at Johns Hopkins University.  Thank you.

Regards,
